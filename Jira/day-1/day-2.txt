In Jira Service Management, Epics, Bugs, Stories, and Tasks represent different types of work items that help organize and manage project development and support requests. Here’s a brief explanation of each:
Need to check daily tasks on it and get to know what are assigned to you 
Epics:

Definition: An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks (stories or tasks). It typically represents a high-level feature or initiative that spans multiple sprints.

Use case: Organizing major features or significant project goals.

Bugs:

Definition: A Bug is a defect or issue in the system that causes the software to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.

Use case: Tracking and resolving problems in the system that need fixing.

Stories:

Definition: A Story represents a unit of work, typically a user-focused feature or requirement. It is smaller than an Epic and describes functionality from the user’s perspective.

Use case: Capturing specific user needs or functionalities that can be developed in a sprint.

Tasks:

Definition: A Task is a smaller, specific piece of work that doesn’t necessarily fit into a Story. It is often used for operational or non-user-facing work that needs to be completed.

Use case: Managing technical, operational, or support activities.
These issue types help structure work in Jira Service Management, making it easier to track progress, prioritize work, and manage large projects or support workflows.
