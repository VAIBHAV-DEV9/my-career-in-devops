JIRA -service management tool
Customizable workflows: Allows teams to define how requests are handled from start to finish.


Self-service portal: End users can submit requests and track their status.

Automation: Automates routine tasks such as ticket assignment and notifications.

Knowledge base: Integrates with Confluence to provide self-help articles for customers.

SLAs: Tracks service level agreements to ensure response and resolution times are met.

Reports & Analytics: Provides insights into team performance and service metrics.

1. Backlog
The backlog is a prioritized list of work items (often called "issues" or "user stories") that need to be completed for a project. These can include features, tasks, bugs, or any work items that need attention. The backlog is managed by the product owner (or equivalent) and serves as a dynamic list that evolves over time.

Product Backlog: This is the overall list of features or improvements for the product.
Sprint Backlog: A subset of the product backlog that is selected for completion in an upcoming sprint.


2. Sprints
A sprint is a fixed period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which a specific set of tasks (from the sprint backlog) is worked on and completed. The goal is to deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.

Sprint Planning: At the start of a sprint, the team selects items from the backlog and commits to completing them during the sprint.

Sprint Execution: During the sprint, the team works on the selected tasks, collaborating and using tools like Jira to track progress.

Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team reviews what was completed with stakeholders.

Sprint Retrospective: A reflection meeting where the team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and how to improve in the next sprint.
How They Use Them

Backlog Management: The backlog is continuously refined (groomed), with tasks getting updated, prioritized, or decomposed into smaller tasks.
Sprint Planning: The team selects a manageable set of tasks from the backlog that they can complete within the sprint. These are moved into the sprint backlog.
Tracking Progress: As the sprint progresses, team members update the status of tasks in Jira (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done").
End of Sprint: The team demonstrates completed work, and the backlog is updated for future sprints.
Jira uses boards to visualize the progress of tasks during a sprint, typically using a Kanban board or a Scrum board, helping teams track work in real-time.
