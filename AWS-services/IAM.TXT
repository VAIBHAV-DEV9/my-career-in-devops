AWS IAM ( identity and access management) is a service that helps you securely control accessto aws resources.
with IAM we can create and manage users,groups,roles,and permissions to allows or deny access to specific resources.
accessing IAM and creating IAM users.
--> in the iam dashboard goto users and click add user,
--> give the user a  unique name--> choose whether the user should have programmatic access(visa aws cli,sdks) or aws managament console access( via web console).
set permissions; assign direct permissions (like s3fullaccess or ec2 readonly)
add the user to groups with predefined permissions.
or assign custom policies if needed.
CREATE IAM ROLES: --> in the iam console, go to roles and click "create role"
 --> select the entity that will assume the role(eg : aws service, aws another account0
 --> assign permissions attach one more policies to the role to define what resources and actions the role has access to .
 attach the role to an ec2 instance or lambda function, depending on the use case.
 SETTING PERMISSIONS AND POLICIES:  --> policies define permissions in json format. for example a policy could grant red-only access to s3 bucket or full access to ec2 instances.
 --> aws provide predefined policies (eg admistrtaoraccess, amazons3readonlyaccess).
 you create custom policies to our needs.
 --> attach policies to users, groups, or roles to define their permissions.
 --> setup MFA 
 --> monitor and access with iam analyzer.
 conclusion;  IAM is a critical service for managing access and permissions within AWS.
